# Prologue 
***Programming*** is a art of *learning constantly* and applying the basic design principles into practice. This is analogous to *Creating a __"Beautiful Picture of a Scene"__*
, *Drawing __Stunning Graphics in Computer Softwares__* and *applying the __constitutional laws to decide the actions of the government__.**

***Software Engineers***  are the artists of a well organised system, like a Designer is a creator of a piece of art. 
*A Designer can demonstrate his mettle by involving in the __actual design process__ , this is where the true learning starts.*
In case of ***Software Engineers*** the projects that mimic the design problem faced by the companies can help in gaining insights of a problem at hand and leads to a
*Stunning, Beautiful, Reliable, Scalable, Extensible ,Comprehensible, Logical and Magical* __Software__ that solves a basic computational problem in different contexts.

As i follow a ***bottom up approach*** to solve a problem at hand, I think that it is imperative to start with *small projects with limited scope* and then move on to a **project with even larger scope**.

Now, if i am trying to define a Project to you, i need to clear the actual meaning of a Project at this Github account. 
**All Projects have a same structure, and are uniquely defined by the PROBLEM STATEMENT of the project** ,following headings form a documentation of a project......
1. PROBLEM STATEMENT
2. DETAILED ANALYSIS 
3. TECHNICAL STACK
4. SOLUTION APPROACH 
5. DIAGRAMATIC REPRESENTATION
6. IMPLEMENTATION 
7. TEST STRATEGY
8. ANALYSIS OF RESULT
9. SCOPE FOR IMPROVEMENT
10. LEARNING 

***THESE HEADINGS CAN ALSO INCLUDE SUB-HEADINGS IF I NEED A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF ABSTRACTION***
